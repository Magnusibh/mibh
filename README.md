### Stock market analysis
Two part project;

#### 1: Filtering stock market data
Trying to examine the passing stock market data through "low pass" filter allows a LSTM recurrent neural network to pick up more long term tendencies in the market

#### 2: Old stock market data vs. recent data
The stock market is nowadays thought to be random and follows a random walk hypothesis, but loo

### Uncovering the black box of machine learning (Master's thesis) 

Introductory problem:
Seeing if a NN network can develop the concept of quantum mechanics. 
Show that the scr√∂dinger extracted from the update laws of a recurrent network performing a potential-to-density mapping of a 1D randomly generated potenials.
